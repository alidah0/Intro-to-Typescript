# Intro to Typescript


I start learning TypeScript and It's kind of fun, and before I start build my project I want to be familiar with the fundamental concepts of Typescript.

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. In this repo,I will go over the fundamental concepts like variable declarations, variable types, functions, interfaces, classes and access modifiers.

main.ts is what I wrote and main.js is how ts compile it after checking the types
